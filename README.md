# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

first open command prompt and navigate to project folder.

In the project directory, type below command on the prompt and press enter:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.



### Download and Install `AccessDatabaseEngine.exe`

Navigate to URL: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54920 and download your driver based on your machines (32 bit / 64 bit)

Download the file by clicking the Download button and saving the file to your hard disk.

Double-click the AccessDatabaseEngine.exe program file on your hard disk to start the setup program.

Follow the instructions on the screen to complete the installation.

To use this download:

If you are the user of an application, consult your application documentation for details on how to use the appropriate driver.

If you are an application developer using OLEDB, set the Provider argument of the ConnectionString property to “Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0”


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `install Node JS`

**Note: Your installation file version may be different at the time of your installation. URL `https://nodejs.org/en/download/`, but please only select LTE!**

Select the Windows installer according to your system environment (32-bit or 64-bit).

Run the downloaded Node.js installer. 

Accept the license agreement. You can leave other settings as default. The installer will install Node.js and prompt you to click on the finish button.

Verify that Node.js was properly installed by opening the command prompt and typing this command: node --version

When we install Node.js, NPM (Node Package Manager) also gets installed. NPM is included in the installation as it includes many libraries that are used in web applications like React. So let’s verify if it's installed using this command in cmd: npm --version

That’s all we need to do for a successful Node.js installation on a Windows system! If you're a Windows user, you can skip the next section and jump straight to the section in which we'll create a basic Node.js server to verify if everything works as expected.
